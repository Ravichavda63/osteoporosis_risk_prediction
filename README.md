The PowerPoint presentation is titled **"Osteoporosis Risk Prediction"** and outlines a comprehensive machine learning approach to predict the risk of osteoporosis. Here's an overview of its key sections and content:
### **1. Introduction**
- **Problem Statement**: The goal is to develop a robust machine learning model to predict osteoporosis risk, aiming for early intervention and better patient outcomes.
- **Objectives**: Steps include data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation.
### **2. Reasons for Osteoporosis**
- Factors like **smoking**, **alcohol consumption**, **obesity**, and a **sedentary lifestyle** are identified as contributors to osteoporosis risk.
### **3. Data Gathering and Preparation**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Focused on understanding data patterns and trends, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Identified **no missing values** but addressed **duplicate values** and **outliers** using the **IQR method** and **Box-Cox transformation**.
  - Split data into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** sets with stratification to maintain the target variable's distribution.
### **4. Machine Learning Models Used**
- Models compared include:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Random Forest Classifier**
  - **Decision Tree Classifier** (performed the best with accuracy ~89-91%)
  - **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
### **5. Model Evaluation**
- Metrics like **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score** were used for performance evaluation.
- **Heatmaps** and **correlation matrices** revealed **age** as a key predictor, with weaker correlations for other features.
### **6. Results**
- Charts and visuals highlight that certain groups, such as underweight individuals, have a higher risk of osteoporosis.
- Models were compared using evaluation metrics, showing trade-offs between simplicity, interpretability, and computational cost.
### **7. Conclusion**
- **Key Findings**:
  - Decision Tree Classifier was the best-performing model but risks overfitting.
  - The analysis suggests that factors beyond the dataset, such as genetics and lifestyle, could enhance predictions.
- **Limitations**:
  - Small dataset size and reliance on a single dataset.
  - Lack of real-world testing or evaluation on external datasets.
- **Future Research**: Emphasizes the need for robustness, generalizability, and interpretability in future studies.
### **8. Appendices**
- Includes links, codes, and references used in the project.
